**timeViz is an R-based software derived from a popular track-based genomic visualization
package called Gviz (Hahne & Ivanek, 2016).**

This powerful tool will allow users to supply global configuration options and data to plot annotation or data
tracks above or below one or more timelines. The user can control the labels, coloring, grouping, shapes,
and sizes for several items in each of these tracks.
